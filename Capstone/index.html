        <p>Hi. I’m Timothy. Born and raised in Georgia. I’m 32 years old and currently work in the financial services industry. I served four years in the U.S. Air Force working in knowledge operations. I seperated with an honorable discharge in 2014 to utilize my G.I Bill benefits. I graduated from the University of Georgia in 2020 with a degree in Financial Planning.</p>

        <p>After working in financial services industry for a few years now I began to realize its not the career I thought it would be when learning about it in school. 
           After doing my research on coding and web develeopment I would like to make a career change into something more suitable to my interests and talents.
